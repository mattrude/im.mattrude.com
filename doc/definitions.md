## JID
A users unique XMPP address, is called a JID (or for historical reasons, sometimes called a Jabber ID). The JID is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name (or IP address) for the server where that user resides, separated by an at sign `@`, such as username@example.com.

## Transports
One of the original design goals of the early Jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple non-XMPP messaging systems. This was done through *transports* or *gateways*.
