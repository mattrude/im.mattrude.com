## BOSH
Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) used to transport XMPP stanzas.  The result is an HTTP binding for XMPP communications that is useful in situations where a device or client is unable to maintain a long-lived TCP connection to an XMPP server.

## Domain

## DNS

## Gateway

## IP Address

## Jabber

## JID
A users unique [XMPP](#xmpp-server) address, is called a JID (or for historical reasons, sometimes called a Jabber ID). The JID is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name (or [IP address](#ip-address)) for the server where that user resides, separated by an at sign `@`, such as username@example.com.

## Presence

## Prosody

## SRV Records

## Stanza
A group of lines forming the basic recurring metrical unit in XML; like a verse in a poem.

## TCP

## Transports
One of the original design goals of the early Jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple non-XMPP messaging systems. This was done through *transports* or *gateways*.

## XEP

## XMPP server
An XMPP server provides basic messaging, presence, and XML routing features. This page lists Jabber/XMPP server software that you can use to run your own XMPP service, either over the Internet or on a local area network.

## XML
